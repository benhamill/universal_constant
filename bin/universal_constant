At even intervals, a safe margin wider than a Viper, triangular arches support the ceiling, making little alcoves along the two long walls. Some of these alcoves have a Viper each in them, most of them being or awaiting service from the flight deck crew. Equipment is everywhere in an ordered chaos, from fuel hoses and fire safety equipement to rolling toolboxes and ammunition crates.')
