# Universal Constant

I thought I'd write a little text adventure engine. My idea is to tell stories
about characters, borrowing heavily from Escape Velocity: Nova for the random
plot selection and mostly-dialog-based story-telling; from the Mass Effect
series for the crew-building aspect and how each crew member has a story to
learn and from Firefly and Escape Velocity for the kind of character you play.

This repo is just some thought exploration at first.
