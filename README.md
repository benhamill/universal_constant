# Universal Constant

I thought I'd write a little text adventure engine. My idea is to tell stories about characters, borrowing heavily from Escape Velocity: Nova for the random plot selection and mostly-dialog-based story-telling; from the Mass Effect series for the crew-building aspect and how each crew member has a story to learn and from Firefly and Escape Velocity for the kind of character you play.

This repo is just some thought exploration at first.
