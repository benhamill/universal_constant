name: Cockpit
description: The cockpit of Serenity is roughly triangular in floor-plan with two
  chairs, each at a wide console, sitting at about the half-way mark. On the starboard
  side is the pilots station and the port is for the navigator. The room is dominated,
  to forward, by a large wind-shield, divided by structural supports. To the sides
  and aft, various electronic doodads, mechanical gizmos, pipes and conduits cover
  the walls. Along a lowered portion of the ceiling running fore-to-aft in the center
  of the room is an intercom system for the pilot or captain to be able to address
  the whole ship or any specific console therein.

name: Forward Hall
description: ! 'The foreward hall has a narrow walkway down the center running along
  the centerline of the ship and sloping ever so slightly downward as it goes aft.
  The walls, to waist height, slant outward at almost 45 degrees so that there isn''t
  a cramped feeling, and the ceiling arches up from that point to a height of about
  10 feet. Forward, there is a gangway leading up to an area with a raised ceiling
  and a doorway.


  Along the walls at regular intervals are panels with ladder rungs in them. These
  are hinged at the top and may be swung away from the walkway to reveal ladder access
  below to each of the crew cabins. One such panel has been decorated with Christmas
  lights and a hand-painted wooden sign that reads "Kaylee''s Room".


  Towards the aft end of the hallway is a small flat area with two doors: one leading
  aft and one starboard.'
